          specifies which screen edge the panel is on. In un-expanded
          mode the difference between &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; is less
          important - both indicate that this is a horizontal panel -
          but still give a useful hint as to how some panel objects
          should behave. For example, on a &quot;top&quot; panel a menu button
          will pop up its menu below the panel, whereas on a &quot;bottom&quot;
          panel the menu will be popped up above the panel.
