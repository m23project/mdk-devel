Kudzu FAQ:
----------

1) So, what is kudzu?

kudzu is the hardware autodetection & configuration tool, originally
introduced in Red Hat Linux 6.1. It detects changes in the system's
hardware configuration, and gives the option of configuring
added or removed devices. It's set up by default to run at
each boot.

Use of kudzu as a detection library is deprecated except
in specific circumstances. Programs looking for specific devices
should be using HAL to get their device information.

2) What type of devices does kudzu detect?

Currently, kudzu detects:

- PCI cards
- SBUS cards
- serial devices (PnP devices, mice, modems)
- parallel port devices (printers)
- SCSI devices (provided the appropriate SCSI modules are loaded)
- IDE devices
- PS/2 mice
- Keyboards on SPARC

More devices and types will be added in the future.

3) What is kudzu doing when it says 'Configuring device X...'?

Configuration:
- Network:
	- adds an 'ethX' alias, if necessary
- SCSI:
	- adds a 'scsi_hostadapter' alias
- Video card:
	- runs system-config-display
- Sound card:
	- adds an option to modprobe.conf to specify an index
	  for ALSA
- Keyboard
	- for serial console makes sure /etc/inittab and /etc/securetty
	  are ready for serial console operation

Un-configuration:
- Network:
	- removes ethX alias
- SCSI:
	- removes scsi_hostadapterX alias

4) Where do I submit bug reports about kudzu?

5) Are there any known bugs in kudzu?

The serial probe can confuse devices if they are
currently in use. (modems, mice)

Running the serial probe on a machine that is acting
as a serial console can produce odd results.
