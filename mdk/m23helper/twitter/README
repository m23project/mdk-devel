About
-----

This program is a command-line twitter client.  It's primarily intended
for use by servers to twitter alert messages, but can be used by anyone
on the command line.   It can post to twitter, initiate follows, and send
direct messages.   It can also read the friends_timeline feed.

Requirements
------------

I built this to be fairly lightweight.  The only requirements are a 
modern build of perl (5.8+), and LWP::UserAgent.  Everything else that
it needs should be part of stock perl.

Installation
------------

This program is very simple.  If you wish to install it site-wide, put
twitter.pl in your bin path, an dput Twitter.pm into perl's search space, 
or add this to twitter.pl:

     use lib '/path/to/Twitter.pm';
