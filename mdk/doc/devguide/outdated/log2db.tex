\subsection{Introduction}
log2db can log text files to the database. The logged information is stored in the m23 database in the "clientlogs" table. To get log2db to work you have to create a database user and a file to transfer. For further information about creating a database user and set up the database server have a look at the "how to access mysql databases with C++?" chapter.
