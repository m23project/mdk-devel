\subsection{Introduction}
partinfodb transfers the partition and hardware information of the client to the server to make remote management possible. To get partinfodb to work you have to create a database user. For further information about creating a database user and set up the database server have a look at the "how to access mysql databases with C++?" chapter.

\section{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
partinfodb <dbuser> <dbpassword> <serverIP> <clientname> <cut character>
\end{verbatim} 
\begin{itemize}
\item dbuser: user name for the database account 
\item dbpassword: password for the database account 
\item serverIP: ip of the database server
\item clientname: name of the client
\item cut character: Select '.' for english and ',' for german version. You can find out the language setting very easy: the messages printed in the console have the same language that will used for the splitter.
\end{itemize}
