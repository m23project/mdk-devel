Welcome to the m23 development guide. This is a not (yet) finished document because m23 isn't completed yet. You will find useful information about the m23 interna. If you want to develop for m23 this is the right document for you ;).\\
If you don't know what m23 is, you'll get a short answer. m23 will help you to set up hundreds of clients from one place. m23 can partition and format clients, install an operating system and additional programs. With m23 you can manage your clients and keep them up to date. For more information have a look at the m23 user guide.\\
This guide is meant for developers and people who want to know how m23 works only.
\section{What you can expect from this document:}
\begin{itemize}
\item an API reference about all functions used in the m23admin GUI and packages. This will be useful if you want to make changes to m23, build addons or plugins.
\item information about serveral tools developed for m23. The little tools called "m23 helpers" make m23 work. Without them m23 can't do its job. You will learn how these tools work and how to use them.
\end{itemize}
\section{What you can't exspect from this document:}
\begin{itemize}
\item a 100\% description of all functionality of m23. m23 is still in development, things are changing rapidly, so don't expect too much actuality.
\item correct english ;) But I think it is written in a way most people will be able to understand. Don't expect a poem ;)
\end{itemize}
Have fun ;)
